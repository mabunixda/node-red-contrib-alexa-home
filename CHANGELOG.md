# [Fix detection of gen3 devices (1.1.3)](https://github.com/mabunixda/node-red-contrib-alexa-home/releases/tag/1.1.3) - 02 Sep 2019

Thanks to @nepee for the input to fix some json stuff within the detection process.

# [Codecleanup + Registration fix for gen3 devices (1.1.2)](https://github.com/mabunixda/node-red-contrib-alexa-home/releases/tag/1.1.2) - 29 Aug 2019

Internal Code cleanup because of introduction of linting the Code... but 

Also take fix from [derSebbl](https://github.com/mabunixda/node-red-contrib-alexa-home/issues/16#issuecomment-526085758) to get Alexa Gen3 devices to work and hopefully fix #16 

The change of the port is not made per default, because i expect not everybody to have port 80 open and available. It might also cause permissions problems, because that port might not be used by a default linux user e.g.

# [fix http/https configuration setup (1.1.1)](https://github.com/mabunixda/node-red-contrib-alexa-home/releases/tag/1.1.1) - 28 Aug 2019

http/https setup was incorrect routed through the node to reflect http/https setup of node-red

# [multiple fixxes (1.0.4)](https://github.com/mabunixda/node-red-contrib-alexa-home/releases/tag/1.0.4) - 10 Jun 2019

Fixing #21 to get on/off command back - this is now
msg.payload.command = "switch|bri|color"
and also round normalized bri to integer values

With this pull request also colors can be set as quested in #19 ..

the broadcast bug of #16 should now be solved because node-ssdp is listening on all available interfaces already. The setup.xml generation already used the host http header to reflect the incoming request to the setup output.
Also a finding was that alexa does not support endless response bodies. To get around this i stripped all spaces and unused settings from the json files. Hopefully this will solve the update problems #16

# [add error logging for missing node (1.0.1)](https://github.com/mabunixda/node-red-contrib-alexa-home/releases/tag/1.0.1) - 05 Jun 2019

#16 displayed the need that also error logs must be written when no controller node is available - even when this spams the logs when multiple alexa nodes are already present
