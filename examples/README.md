## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Node-RED**: Version 4.0.0 or higher
2. **Node.js**: Version 18.5.0 or higher
3. **Alexa Device**: Echo, Echo Dot, or Alexa app
4. **MQTT Broker** (optional but recommended): Mosquitto, HiveMQ, or similar

### Installation Steps

1. **Install the Node Package**:
   ```bash
   npm install node-red-contrib-alexa-home
   ```

2. **Import Example Flow**:
   - Open Node-RED editor
   - Go to Menu ‚Üí Import
   - Select the JSON file you want to try
   - Click "Import"

3. **Configure MQTT Brokers** (if using MQTT outputs):
   - Double-click any MQTT output node
   - Configure your MQTT broker connection
   - Apply the same broker to all MQTT nodes

4. **Deploy the Flow**:
   - Click the "Deploy" button in Node-RED
   - Wait for successful deployment

5. **Discover Devices with Alexa**:
   - Say "Alexa, discover devices"
   - Or use the Alexa app: More ‚Üí Add Device ‚Üí Other

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Basic Light Control
```javascript
// Manual injection for testing
{
  "on": true,           // Power state
  "bri": 127,          // Brightness (0-254)
  "xy": [0.675, 0.322] // Color (CIE XY coordinates)
}
```

### Scene Activation
```javascript
// Scene controller payload
{
  "on": true  // Activates the scene
}
```

### Fan Speed Control
```javascript
// Fan control via brightness
{
  "on": true,
  "bri_normalized": 66  // 66% = Medium speed
}
```

## üîß Customization

### Modifying Device Names
1. Double-click the Alexa Home node
2. Change the "Device Name" field
3. Redeploy and ask Alexa to discover devices

### Adding New Devices
1. Drag a new "alexa-home" node from the palette
2. Configure device name and type
3. Connect to appropriate processing functions
4. Deploy and discover

### MQTT Topic Structure
```
lights/device_name          # Lighting controls
switches/device_name        # Switch and fan controls
security/device_name        # Locks and garage doors
climate/device_name         # Thermostat controls
sensors/device_name         # Sensor readings
scene/control              # Scene coordination
automation/actions         # Automation triggers
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Device Not Discovered
- Check Node-RED is running and accessible
- Ensure the Alexa Home Controller is configured correctly
- Verify network connectivity between Alexa and Node-RED
- Try saying "Alexa, forget all devices" then rediscover

### Commands Not Working
- Check debug output for error messages
- Verify device names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Ensure flows are deployed successfully
- Test with manual injection nodes first

### Color Commands Issues
- Verify XY coordinates are in valid range (0.0-1.0)
- Check that device type supports color (Color light, Extended color light)
- Use the provided color presets for testing

### MQTT Connection Problems
- Verify MQTT broker is running and accessible
- Check broker configuration in MQTT nodes
- Test MQTT connection with a simple MQTT client
- Ensure topics don't conflict with existing devices

## üìñ Technical Details

### Color Processing
The examples use CIE 1931 XY color space for accurate color representation:
- **X coordinate**: 0.0 to 1.0 (red-green axis)
- **Y coordinate**: 0.0 to 1.0 (luminance axis)
- **Conversion**: XY ‚Üí RGB ‚Üí Hex for device compatibility

### State Management
Device states are stored in Node-RED's global context:
```javascript
// Access device states
const deviceStates = global.get('deviceStates');

// Update device state
deviceStates[deviceName] = {
  power: true,
  brightness: 80,
  lastUpdate: new Date().toISOString()
};
global.set('deviceStates', deviceStates);
```

### Security Logging
Security events are logged with detailed information:
```javascript
{
  timestamp: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  event: {
    type: "lock_operation",
    action: "unlock",
    device: "Front Door Lock",
    source: "alexa_voice_command"
  }
}
```
